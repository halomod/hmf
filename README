THIS IS THE README FOR hmf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

hmf is a python application that provides a flexible and simple way to calculate the 
Halo Mass Function for any input cosmology, redshift, dark matter model, virial
overdensity or several other variables. Addition of further variables should be simple. 

It is also the backend to humf, the online hmf calculator at hmf.icrar.org


INSTALLATION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---- Install Requirements ------
1. Install Python
2. Install numpy, scipy, scitools (easiest way is to pip install)
3. Install pycamb:
	>>> cd <Directory that pycamb source will live in>
	>>> git clone https://github.com/joezuntz/pycamb
	>>> cd pycamb
	>>> sh extract_camb.sh
	>>> [sudo] python setup.py install --nonstop ** Only use --nonstop if using gfortran **
	
---- Install hmf --------------
    >>> cd <Directory that hmf source will live in>
    >>> git clone https://github.com/steven-murray/hmf
    >>> cd hmf
    >>> [sudo] python setup.py install
    
    
USAGE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
hmf can be used interactively (for instance in ipython) or in a script. 
To use interactively, in ipython do something like the following:

>>> from hmf import Perturbations
>>> import numpy as np
>>> M = np.arange(10,15,0.01)
>>> pert_object = Perturbations(M=M)
>>> mass_func = pert_object.MassFunction()

This will return a Sheth-Tormen mass function between 10^10 and 10^15 M_sun, at redshift 0
for a default cosmology. Cosmological parameters may be passed to the initialiser, Perturbations().

Check the docstring of Perturbations() for arguments allowed. 


HISTORY
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0.1 - May 20, 2013
		Added better warnings for non-updated variables passed to update()
		Made default cosmology WMAP7
		
0.9.99- May 10, 2013
		Added warning for k*R limits
		Couple of minor bugfixes
		**Important** Angulo fitting function corrected (arXiv version had a typo).
		
0.9.97- April 15, 2013
		Urgent Bugfix for updating cosmology (for transfer functions)
		
0.9.96- April 11, 2013
		Few bugfixes
		
0.9.95- April 09, 2013
		Added cascading variable changes for optimization
		Added this README
		Added update() function to simply change parameters using cascading approach
		
0.9.9 - April 08, 2013
        First version in its own package
        Added pycamb integration
        Removed fitting function from being a class variable
        Removed overdensity form being a class variable
        
0.9.7 - March 18, 2013
        Modified set_z() so it only does calculations necessary when z changes
        Made calculation of dlnsdlnM in init since it is same for all z
        Removed mean density redshift dependence
        
0.9.5 - March 10, 2013
        The class has been in the works for almost a year now, but it currently
        will calculate a mass function based on any of several fitting functions.
