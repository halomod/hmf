Releases
========

dev
-------
**Notes**
New versions of CAMB (1.0.0+) seem to run significantly slower by default than previous
versions. This could just be a setting in CAMB that has changed its default. Be aware
of this.

**Features**

- Added new ``CambGrowth`` growth factor model, which computes the growth using CAMB. This is useful especially when
  using w > -1, for which the other growth factor models are inadequate. Solves issue #19 raised by @tijmen.
- Added new module ``mass_definitions`` which more robustly deals with various halo mass definitions, and also includes
  ability to convert mass functions between different definitions.

**Bugfixes**

- When using camb for the transfer function, some cosmologies would lead to a segfault (i.e. when Ob0 or Tcmb0 are not
  set explicitly). This now raises a helpful error.

**Internals**

- Removed logging, which was redundant.
- Moved from nose to pytest
- Significant overhaul of package structure to more modularised form.
- Added flake8 checks and black formatting
- Moved away from git-flow as it is not easy to use with GitHub.


v3.0.8 [26th March 2020]
------------------------
**Bugfixes**

- Some documentation and CI fixes.

**Enhancement**

- Added `get_dependencies` method to _Framework, to enable finding all parameters that a quantity depends on.
- Growth factor speed-up (thanks to @jlashner)
- Added use_splined_growth argument (thanks to @jlashner)


v3.0.7 [29th April 2019]
------------------------
**Bugfixes**

- Fixed bugs in WDM models that remained from previous versions.
- Fixed bug in SharpK Ellipsoid filter following previous API change.

v3.0.5 [23rd April 2019]
------------------------
**Bugfixes**

- Fixed naming of WDM `alter_dndm` to `alter_model` to be consistent.
- Fixed bug which made CAMB transfer function not pickleable or copyable.
  NOTE: the fix is not perfect -- if you provide a custom CAMBparams class
        to `transfer_params`, it is not certain that results will be consistent,
        as a few of the attributes of this object are not pickleable, and thus
        are ignored.

v3.0.3 [1st Dec 2017]
---------------------
**Bugfixes**

- Fixed usage of deprecated MsolMass in wdm
- Fixed Bhattachrya fitting function (thanks to Benedikt Diemer!)
- Fixed typo in Watson fitting function (thanks to Benedikt Diemer!)
- Update cosmo test to use new Astropy constants.
- Fixed issue with sampling function where zeros in ngtm would yield an error.

v3.0.2 [3rd Nov 2017]
---------------------
**Bugfixes**

- Changed parameter checks on instantiation to post-conversion.

v3.0.1 [31st Oct 2017]
----------------------
**Enhancement**

- Normalised all <>_model properties to be actual classes, rather than either class or string.
- Added consistent checking of dictionaries for <>_params parameters.

v3.0.0 [7th June 2017]
----------------------
**Features**

- Now provides compatibility with Python 3.x. Support for 2.x will be removed in hmf v3.1 (whenever that comes).
- Complete overhaul of the caching system. Should be invisible to the user, but streamlines writing of framework
  code considerably. Removes required manual specification of dependencies between quantities, and adds ability
  to specify parameter kinds (model, param, res, option, switch).

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed bug in Caroll1992 GrowthFactor class which affected high-redshift growth factors (thanks to Olmo Piana).
- Fixed astropy dependency to be >= 1.1
- Fixed bug where Takahashi parameters were always passed through regardess of ``takahashi`` setting.
- Fixed small bug where the functional.get_label method returned differently ordered parameters because of dicts.
- Note that the fitting subpackage is temporarily unsupported and I discourage its use for the time being.

**Enhancement**

- Completely removes dependence on archaic pycamb package. Now supports natively supplied python interface to CAMB.
  Install camb with ``pip install --egg camb``. This means that much more modern versions of CAMB can be used.
- Many new tests, to bring total coverage up to >80%, and continuous testing on Python 2.7, 3.5 and 3.6


v2.0.5 [12th January 2017]
--------------------------
**Bugfixes**

- Fixed bug in GrowthFactor which gave ripples in functions of z when a coarse grid was used. Thanks to @mirochaj and
  @thomasguillet!

**Enhancments**

- Streamlined the caching framework a bit (removing cruft)
- Totally removed dependency on the Cache (super)class -- caching indexes now inherent to the called class.
- More robust parameter information based on introspection.


v2.0.4 [11th November, 2016]
----------------------------

**Bugfixes**

- **IMPORTANT**: Fixed a bug in which updating the cosmology after creation did not update the transfer function.

v2.0.3 [22nd September, 2016]
-----------------------------
**Bugfixes**

- SharpK filter integrated over incorrect range of k, now fixed.

**Enhancments**

- WDM models now more consistent with MassFunction API.
- Better warning in HALOFIT module when derivatives don't work first time.


v2.0.2 [2nd August, 2016]
-------------------------

**Features**

- Added a bunch of information to each hmf_model, indicating simulation parameters from which the fit was derived.
- Added ``FromArray`` transfer model, allowing an array to be passed programmatically for `k` and `T`.
- Added ``Carroll1992`` growth factor approximation model.

**Enhancments**

- how_big now gives the boxsize required to expect at least one halo above m in 95% of boxes.

**Bugfixes**

- Removed unnecessary multiplication by 1e6 in cosmo.py (thanks @iw381)
- **IMPORTANT**: normalisation now calculated using convergent limits on k, rather than
  user-supplied values.
- **IMPORTANT**: fixed bug in Bhattacharya fit, which was multiplying by an extra delta_c/sigma.
- fixed issue with ``nonlinear_mass`` raising exception when mass outside given mass range.

v2.0.1 [2nd May, 2016]
----------------------

**Bugfixes**

- Corrects the default sigma_8 and n (spectral index) parameters to be from Planck15 (previously
  from Planck13), which corresponds to the default cosmology. **NOTE:** this will change user-code
  output silently unless sigma_8 and n are explicitly set.


v2.0.0
------
v2.0.0 is a (long overdue) major release with several backward-incompatible changes.
There are several major features still to
come in v2.1.0, which may again be backward incompatible. Though this is not ideal (ideally
backwards-incompatible changes will be restricted to increase in the major version number),
this has been driven by time constraints.

Known issues with this version, to be addressed by the next, are that both scripts (hmf and hmf-fit)
are buggy and untested. Don't use these until the next version unless you're crazy.

**Features**

- New methods on all frameworks to list all parameters, defaults and current values.
- New general structure for Frameworks and Components makes for simpler delineation and extensibility
- New growth_factor module which adds extensibility to the growth factor calculation
- New transfer_models module which separates the transfer models from the general framework
- New Component which can alter dn/dm in WDM via ad-hoc adjustment
- Added a Prior() abstract base class to the fitting routines
- Added a guess() method to fitting routines
- Added ll() method to Prior classes for future extendibility
- New fit from Ishiyama+2015, Manera+2010 and Pillepich+2009

**Enhancments**

- Removed nz and z2 from MassFunction. They will return in a later version but better.
- Improved structure for FittingFunction Component, with `cutmask` property defining valid mass range. NOTE: the default
  MassFunction is no longer to mask values outside the valid range. In fact, the parameter ``cut_fit`` no longer exists.
  One can achieve the effect by accessing a relevant array as dndm[MassFunction.hmf.cutmask]
- Renamed some parameters/quantities for more consistency (esp. M --> m)
- No longer dependent on cosmolopy, but rather uses Astropy (v1.0+)
- `mean_dens` now `mean_density0`, as per Astropy
- Added exception to catch when dndm has many NaN values in it.
- Many more tests
- Made the `cosmo` class pickleable by cutting out a method and using it as a function instead.
- Added normalise() to Transfer class.
- Updated fit.py extensively, and provided new example config files
- Send arbitrary kwargs to downhill solver
- New internal _utils module provides inheritable docstrings

**Bugfixes**

- fixed problem with _gtm method returning nans.
- fixed simple bugs in BBKS and BondEfs transfer models.
- fixes in _cache module
- simple bug when updating sigma_8 fixed.
- Made the EnsembleSampler object pickleable by setting ``__getstate__``
- Major bug fix for EH transfer function without BAO wiggles
- @parameter properties now return docstrings
